# Libft

**Libft** is a C library created within the 42 curriculum that focuses on reimplementing standard C functions while adding extra utility functions to facilitate development and reuse in future projects.

---

## 📖 Description

The purpose of **libft** is to provide a personal C library containing implementations of classic standard functions (e.g., `strlen`, `strcpy`, `memset`, etc.), along with extra utility functions to support future development.

By completing this project, you will gain:
- A stronger understanding of the C language
- A reusable foundation for all subsequent projects
- A library that can be easily linked to any C program

---

## Objective

The main aim of this project is to deepen your knowledge of:
- String and memory manipulation in C
- Low-level operations (`malloc`, `free`, `write`, etc.)
- Writing safe, reliable, and robust code
- Structuring modular and maintainable C programs

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `includes/libft.h` — headers and function prototypes  
- `srcs/` — function implementations  
- `Makefile` — compiles the library with `make`, generating `libft.a`

---

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bernardofg/42Libft.git
```
2. Compile the library:
```bash
make
```
